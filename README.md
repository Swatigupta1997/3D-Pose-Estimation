# 3D-Pose-Estimation
This repository contains all the necessary files required to implement  3-D pose estimation using GANs.

## Procedure
Perfom the following steps to implement the 3-D pose estimation:
1. Obtain 2-D joint locations using OpenPose.
2. Implement GANs for 3-D human pose estimation using the 2-D joint location.

### Obtain 2-D joint locations using OpenPose
     - Update the different file paths in Module1_OpenPose.ipynb.
     - Run the colab notebook.
### Obtain 3-D human poses using GANs
     - Update the different file paths in 3d_pose_estimation_GANs.ipynb.
     - Run the colab notebook.
